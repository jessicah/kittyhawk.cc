<h2>Fierce Felines p/b Kittyhawk</h2>

<h3>Event Information</h3>
<p>
	The <strong>Fierce Felines</strong> is a series by <strong>Kittyhawk
	Racing</strong>, providing hard racing for
	women across three timezones. We believe that women need more opportunities to race against women, and that races should be as equally hard
	as some of the top mens racing in Zwift. This series provides races that should cater to all abilities, with time trials, points races,
	fairly flat road races, and hilly road races.

<h3>Race Details</h3>

<h4>Week 1: Handful of Gravel</h4>
<p>
	Week 1 starts off with a scratch race, no segments on this course, but bumpy enough to
	make racing difficult. The race will do four laps of this mostly gravel course.
</p>
<p>
	Finish time determines finish order.
</p>
<p>
	Powerups: Leaf, Anvil, and the Steamroller.
</p>

<h4>Week 2: Downtown Dolphin</h4>
<p>
	Week 2 drops you into a points race, points will be awarded on the Downtown Dolphin QOM, and
	double points for the finish.
	For this event, categories will be separated, due to the extremely short nature of the
	course.

</p>

</p>

<h4>Week 3: Bologna TT</h4>

	Pretty simple: grab your best TT rig, and settle in for a world of hurt.
</p>
<p>
	Finish time determines finish order.
</p>

<h4>Week 4: Climber's Gambit</h4>
<p>
	An epic stage to the top of the Epic QOM. There will be FTS bonus points on the intermediate sprint

<h4>Week 5: Greatest London Flat</h4>
<p>
	Back into scratch racing territory, with FTS bonus points on the intermediate sprint on the Mall
	Sprint (reverse).
</p>
<p>
	Finish time determines points: 50, 49, 48, ..., 1. 1 point for the rest.

<h4>Week 6: Chain Chomper</h4>
<p>
	And back into the hills, two laps, with FAL points on Castle & Temple KOMs, and FTS bonus points
	for the Country Sprint.

<h4>Week 7: Sprinter's Playground</h4>

	Another two laps, this time in the heart of Neokyo, eight sprints in total, and double points for
	the finish line.
</p>
<p>
	All sprints: 10, 9, 8, ... 3, 2, 1.
</p>
<p>
	Finish time: 20, 19, 18, ..., 3, 2, 1.
</p>
<p>
	Total awarded points determines finish order.
</p>

<h4>Week 8: Triple Flat Loops</h4>
<p>
	It's back to the TT rigs, but this time on the much flatter roads of Watopia to round out the series.
</p>
<p>
	Finish time determines finish order.
</p>

<h3>The Finish Order Points Structure</h3>

<p>
	These are the points that will be accumulated in the results table, and all eight
	weeks will contribute to your total. This may be changed to your best six results,
	if it makes the series more appealing.
</p>

<p>
	There will also be a Sprint Queen, and Queen of the Mountains competition, where
	the fastest overall time for each unique sprint segment, and each unique climbing
	segment earn points. The points will be 10, 9, 8, ..., down to 1 point for the
	fastest 10 riders. This means that if you race through a given segment multiple
	times, only your fastest time will count. You will still need to finish the race
	to be eligible.
</p>

<p>
	For the team's classification, it will take the best rider of each scored segment
	and the best placed rider at the finish, to contribute to your team's score.
