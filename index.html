<h2>Women's Events by Kittyhawk Racing</h2>

<p>
	Currently, only the Fierce Felines is on the calendar. We are also
	evaluating whether there is interest in a couple other formats, and when the
	best times might be for putting these on. These include dedicated races for
	the time trial, criterium, and climbing formats, as well as the chase format.

<p>
	If you could spare a few minutes, please complete our <a

<h3>Fierce Felines</h3>
<p>
	Fierce Felines is starting off with a short 4-week series, with a time
	trial, a scratch race in the dirt, a criterium, and finishing with a little
	bit of hill climbing, beginning July 15th.
</p>
<p>
	The current points format is 50, 47, 45, 44, 43, ..., 3, 2, 1, but this may
	be tweaked in the future, such as bonus points for fastest times and/or
	first across the line for various segments/laps to make the competition a
	bit spicier. Feedback about FTS/FAL is included in the survey above.
