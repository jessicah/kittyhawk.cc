<h2>Women's Events by Kittyhawk Racing</h2>

<p>
	Currently, only the Fierce Felines is on the calendar. We are also
	evaluating whether there is interest in a couple other formats, and when the
	best times might be for putting these on. These include dedicated races for
	the time trial, criterium, and climbing formats, as well as the chase format.

<h3>Fierce Felines</h3>
<p>
	Fierce Felines is currently in series 2 of 2023, and the first full 8-week
	calendar. Unfortunately, it does clash with the Iceni series during
	September, so numbers will be lighter for the second half.
</p>
<p>
	Please see the <a href='/fierce'>full series details</a>, and the
	<a href='/fierce/results'>published results</a>, which aim to be updated no later
	than late Sunday.
</p>
<p>
	The current points format is 50, 47, 45, 44, 43, ..., 3, 2, 1, with select
	events using a points format, that will be described on the series details
	page, as well as in the Zwift event information.
