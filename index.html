<h2>Women's Events by Kittyhawk Racing</h2>

<p>
	Currently, only the Fierce Felines is back on the calendar. We are also
	evaluating whether there is interest in a couple other formats, and when the
	best times might be for putting these on. These include dedicated races for
	the time trial, criterium, and climbing formats, as well as the chase format.
