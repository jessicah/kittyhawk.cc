<h2>Women's Events Survey</h2>

<p>
	Kittyhawk is looking into adding additional events to the calender, and will
	appreciate your participation in the survey to get a feeling of what racers
	are looking for.
</p>
<p>
	Additional race formats are dedicated series for climbing, time trialing,
	and criteriums (points races), and the chase race format. The chase race
	format is definitely one that Kittyhawk is quite interested in, as there is
	not a lot of opportunity for women in current chase races.
</p>
<p>
	Kittyhawk is also looking for feedback on your current timezone, and times
	available for racing in, to achieve suitable event scheduling.
</p>
<p>
	Finally, trying to gauge interest in how racers feel about fastest timed
	segments and first across the line bonus points, and whether racers are
	willing to trial racing without the HUD, in an effort to make racing more
	tactical.
</p>
<p>
	So if you can spare a few minutes, please complete our <a
	href="https://forms.gle/6Y1anHisy1eoDQds5">survey</a>, Kittyhawk thanks you
	very much for your input!
</p>
